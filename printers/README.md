# Scripts for Stationeers printers
These are the scripts I use for automating printers in Stationeers. I learned and borrowed bits from CowsAreEvil for this, but made it my own. I have separated the various functions out to different chips. The functions are:
|Function|Description|Script|
--- | --- | ---|
|AutoStop|Automatically stops the printer once it has printed out the number of items equal to its attached stacker's setting at the time the print job started.|https://github.com/drclaw1188/stationeers_ic10/blob/main/printers/PrinterAutoStop.ic10|
|PrinterMaster|Delivers ingots to printers automatically from a vending machine.|https://github.com/drclaw1188/stationeers_ic10/blob/main/printers/PrinterMaster_v3.ic10|
